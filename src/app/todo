animate circles?
add basic music
add sound effects/drums
some kind of path, suggest standard tower defense thing?

DONE
make a base with crash-effect that triggers on touch (with timeout)
add tougher enemy



THOUGHTS
maybe start of with set towers, challenge is to "solve the beat". then a few levels like that, can't build anything
then (if time) can add a different challenge where you can build and place towers, and perhaps the beat is set? and you can upgrade the beat by paying.
focus on first. 
but what about paths? nothing stopping me from having angled movement. perhaps start with everyone from left?
