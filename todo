animate circles?
add basic music
add sound effects/drums
some kind of path, suggest standard tower defense thing?

DONE
make a base with crash-effect that triggers on touch (with timeout)
add tougher enemy



THOUGHTS
maybe start of with set towers, challenge is to "solve the beat". then a few levels like that, can't build anything
then (if time) can add a different challenge where you can build and place towers, and perhaps the beat is set? and you can upgrade the beat by paying.
focus on first. 
but what about paths? nothing stopping me from having angled movement. perhaps start with everyone from left?

some kind of

Todo!

make the blobs clickable! maybe pay to add one? or maybe you can move them? moving means they wont be used for one (?) block.

decide: is the towers there already? or do we add them? no
more fun if towers are there and you have to figure out a rhythm. start small, earn money for each death, buy more tower-triggers. make sure the level gets increasingly hard until you win by having ~all the towers

make a song!

if you beat it, endless level? one "level" of increasing diff is ok. it's like the jumping games. 
IF there is time we can have one "simple" and one "hard" etc

ok ok 
so one levle, inc difficulty, you get money so we know what towers you can afford, the challenge is to figure out which beat works, and each wave might prefer a different beat - so you can infact NOT move your towers.

start VERY easy or have a tutorial

so maybe: TUTORIAL, EASY, HARD ?

intro screen


NEON colours. particles! moving "camera"? yeah probably not :)

Conclusions:

start menu: 
Tutorial
Easy level
Medium Level
HARD level
Endless mode ? (random?)


other stuff:
intro screen w/ dollarone while loading
loading text?
main menu screen
R to reset or reset button  for mobile

pulsating floor for bass, small "flashes" for hats, other lights for snare, big light for crash?

sailing "bits" in the background - maybe lasers

welcome!

a quick tutorial (click button below to skip)

<story>



next:
(re)start level and restart game buttons
intro screen w/ dollarone while loading
pulsating floor for bass, small "flashes" for hats, other lights for snare, big light for crash?
sailing "bits" in the background - maybe lasers 
then... just levels (oh, save money and life for every level, so you can reset)
make it superhard at level 10
each level has different layout
maybe level10 you start with 0 money
basically 10 challenges to "solve" but also you keep your layout
start with 0
YOU LOSE zoom-text when you lose and frozen cash/life
YOU WIN zoom text when you win (they dont fade out) and frozen cash/life
oops...more song

OK so MVP:
1 long level - layout and enemy spawn is key
start with 0
just start/restart game button
longer song
you lose/win effect
bits in background if time
